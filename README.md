# A Primer on Vector Autoregressions
### Miguel C. Herculano

### Overview

The goal of this notebook is to encourage the use of Vector Autoregressions (VARs) by reducing the computational entry costs that preclude the deployment of VARs. The notebook guides the user through a VAR model Workflow that (we hope) can be used as a template for alternative applications. The intuition and key results behind much of the tools derived from Vector Autoregressions are briefly discussed. The interested reader may refer to the reference section for a suggestion of further reading.
